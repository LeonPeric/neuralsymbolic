    """
    Prepares the dataset for MNIST single digit addition. Adapted from https://github.com/tommasocarraro/LTNtorch

    :return: a tuple of two elements. The first element is the training set, while the second element is the test set.
    Both training set and test set are lists that contain the following information:
        1. a list [left_operands, right_operands], where left_operands is a list of MNIST images that are used as the
        left operand of the addition, while right_operands is a list of MNIST images that are used as the right operand
        of the addition;
        2. a list containing the summation of the labels of the images contained in the list at point 1. The label of
        the left operand is added to the label of the right operand, and the target label is generated. This represents
        the target of the digits addition task.
    Note that this is the output of the process for the single digit case. In the multi digits case the list at point
    1 will have 4 elements since in the multi digits case four digits are involved in each addition (two digits
    represent the first operand and two digits the second operand).
